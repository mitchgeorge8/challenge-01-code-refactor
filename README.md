# Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

This challenge activity is called Code Refactor. I will be taking pre-made code for a marketing website and refactoring it to meet the below acceptance criteria.

## Description

The challenge for this week, Module 1, is to refactor a pre-built website to make it more accessible. That means that the code must be formatted in a way that screen readers can easily sort through the content and read it to the user in a logical and meaningul way. Making the website more accessible will also better position it in search engines like Google. Search engines prioritize website for many reasons, one of them being accessibility.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency<br/>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br/>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br/>
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br/>
WHEN I view the source code<br/>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br/>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br/>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br/>
WHEN I view the image elements<br/>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br/>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br/>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br/>
WHEN I view the title element<br/>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br/>
```
