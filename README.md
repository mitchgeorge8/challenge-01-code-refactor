# Module 1 Challenge: Code Refactor

This challenge activity is called Code Refactor. I will be taking pre-made code for a marketing website and refactoring it to meet the below acceptance criteria.

## Description

The challenge for this week, Module 1, is to refactor a pre-built website to make it more accessible. That means that the code must be formatted in a way that screen readers can easily sort through the content and read it to the user in a logical and meaningul way. Making the website more accessible will also better position it in search engines like Google. Search engines prioritize website for many reasons, one of them being accessibility.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
